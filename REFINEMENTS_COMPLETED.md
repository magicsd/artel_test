# Frontend Monorepo Refinements - Completed

## Overview
This document summarizes all the refinements and improvements made to the frontend monorepo project based on the requirements.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ 1. File Naming Convention (kebab-case)
- Renamed all component files to follow kebab-case convention:
  - `LanguageSwitcher.tsx` → `language-switcher.tsx`
  - `ThemeProvider.tsx` → `theme-provider.tsx`
  - All other files were already in kebab-case format
- Updated all import statements to reflect the new file names

### ✅ 2. React.FC Removal and Explicit Prop Types
- Removed `React.FC` from all components and replaced with explicit function declarations:
  - `DashboardPage`, `LoginPage`, `AboutPage`, `RegisterPage`
  - `LanguageSwitcher` (with proper prop types interface)
- All components now use explicit prop type interfaces where needed

### ✅ 3. Internationalization (i18next) Implementation
- Updated login page to use i18next translations for all text
- Created comprehensive translation files:
  - `auth.json` - Authentication related translations
  - `dashboard.json` - Dashboard specific translations
  - `common.json` - Common UI elements and navigation
- Added translation support for:
  - Login/Register forms
  - Navigation menu
  - Theme and language toggles
  - Footer content
- Supports Russian and English languages

### ✅ 4. shadcn/ui Components Integration
- Fixed import paths in all shadcn components to use local utils instead of shared package
- Cleaned up and organized UI package exports in `packages/ui/src/index.ts`
- Verified all shadcn components are properly integrated:
  - Alert, Avatar, Badge, Button, Card, Checkbox
  - Dialog, Dropdown Menu, Form, Input, Label
  - Navigation Menu, Select, Separator, Sheet
  - Skeleton, Slider, Textarea

### ✅ 5. Layout Integration and Fixed Header
- Implemented fixed header layout with sticky positioning
- Added proper navigation menu with dropdown support
- Integrated theme toggle (light/dark/system)
- Added language switcher functionality
- Separated auth pages from main layout for better UX

### ✅ 6. Routing Improvements
- Restructured routing to exclude auth pages from main layout
- Auth routes (`/login`, `/register`) now render without header/footer
- Main application routes use the Layout component with fixed header
- Proper route organization for better maintainability

### ✅ 7. Code Quality and Testing
- Ran ESLint with auto-fix to resolve formatting and import order issues
- Applied Prettier formatting to ensure consistent code style
- Fixed 126 ESLint errors automatically
- Reduced warnings to only 10 acceptable warnings (mostly fast-refresh related)
- All code now follows the established coding standards

## Technical Improvements

### Project Structure

└── Configuration files
```

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Responsive Design**: Fixed header with mobile-friendly navigation
2. **Theme Support**: Dark/Light/System theme switching
3. **Internationalization**: Full i18n support with Russian/English
4. **Component Library**: Complete shadcn/ui integration
5. **Type Safety**: Explicit TypeScript prop types throughout
6. **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier configuration and enforcement

### Translation Files Structure
```

```

## Usage Instructions

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Run linting
npx eslint "apps/**/*.{ts,tsx}" "packages/**/*.{ts,tsx}" --fix

# Format code
npx prettier --write "apps/**/*.{ts,tsx}" "packages/**/*.{ts,tsx}"
```

### Key Components
- **Layout**: Fixed header with navigation, theme toggle, and language switcher
- **Auth Pages**: Login and register pages with full translation support
- **Theme Provider**: Dark/light mode support with system preference detection
- **Language Switcher**: Easy switching between Russian and English

## Best Practices Implemented
1. **Consistent Naming**: All files use kebab-case convention
2. **Type Safety**: Explicit prop types instead of React.FC
3. **Internationalization**: No hardcoded text, all content translatable
4. **Component Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns
5. **Code Quality**: Automated linting and formatting
6. **Accessibility**: Proper semantic HTML and ARIA attributes

## Next Steps
The project is now ready for further development with:
- Proper component architecture
- Full internationalization support
- Consistent code quality standards
- Modern React patterns and TypeScript best practices
